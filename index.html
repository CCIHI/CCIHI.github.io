        <h3>COMPUTER VISION</h3>
        <p>Computer vision is a science that studies how to make machines "see". Further, it refers to using cameras and computers to identify, track and measure targets instead of human eyes, and further processing the images, so that they can be processed by computers into images that are more suitable for human eyes to observe or sent to instruments for detection.
        <br>
        As a scientific discipline, computer vision studies related theories and technologies, trying to establish an artificial intelligence system that can obtain "information" from images or multidimensional data. The information here refers to the information defined by Shannon, which can be used to help make a "decision". Because perception can be regarded as extracting information from sensory signals, computer vision can also be regarded as a science to study how to make artificial systems "perceive" from images or multidimensional data. ......read more</p>

            Dr. Fei-Fei Li of Stanford University is a rare female pioneer in the development of modern AI.
            Overcoming the shortage of resources and talents during the period of AI's low development, Committed to the study of machine vision and contributed to the breakthrough of "deep learning". 
            The algorithm can not only see, but also understand things. It also makes big data oﬃcially float on the table, which makes AI have further application value.
            <br>
            This book is a memoir written by Fei-Fei Li herself. Tell about her growth, study and research career in China and the United States. Her parents' example and words and deeds led her natural curiosity to the road of science.
            <br>
            When my family immigrated to the United States in middle school, under the circumstances of financial constraints and language barriers, She was determined to finish her studies and turned from physics to AI. Later, she decided to use AI to help human beings, ......read more</p>

        <p>Dr. Fei-Fei Li is the inaugural Sequoia Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, and Co-Director of Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Institute. She served as the Director of Stanford’s AI Lab from 2013 to 2018. And during her sabbatical from Stanford from January 2017 to September 2018, Dr. Li was Vice President at Google and served as Chief Scientist of AI/ML at Google Cloud. Since then she has served as a Board member or advisor in various public or private companies. Dr. Fei-Fei Li obtained her B.A. degree in physics from Princeton in 1999 with High Honors, and her PhD degree in electrical engineering from California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 2005. She also holds a Doctorate Degree (Honorary) from Harvey Mudd College.
            <br>
            Dr. Fei-Fei Li’s current research interests include cognitively inspired AI, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, robotic learning, and AI+healthcare especially ambient intelligent systems for healthcare delivery. In the past she has also worked on cognitive and computational neuroscience. Dr. Li has published more than 300 scientific articles in top-tier journals and conferences in science, engineering and computer science. Dr. Li is the inventor of ImageNet and the ImageNet Challenge, a critical large-scale dataset and benchmarking eﬀort that has contributed to the latest developments in deep learning and AI. <span class="highlight">......read more</span></p>
