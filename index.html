        <h3 class="CPTV_W">What is Computer vision . . . ?</h3>
        <p class="CPTV_W my-5">Computer vision is a science that studies how to make machines "see". Further, it refers to using cameras and computers to identify, track and measure targets instead of human eyes, and further processing the images, so that they can be processed by computers into images that are more suitable for human eyes to observe or sent to instruments for detection.
        <br><br>
        As a scientific discipline, computer vision studies related theories and technologies, trying to establish an artificial intelligence system that can obtain "information" from images or multidimensional data. The information here refers to the information defined by Shannon, which can be used to help make a "decision". Because perception can be regarded as extracting information from sensory signals, computer vision can also be regarded as a science to study how to make artificial systems "perceive" from images or multidimensional data.</p>

            <h3>Crowdsourcing in Computer Vision</h3>
            <p>Author :  Fei-Fei Li <br>
                Publishing :  Flatiron Books <br>
                Publication date :  2023/11/07<br>

            <h6>
                Introduction</h6><br><br><p>
                Computer vision systems require large amounts of manually annotated data to properly learn challenging visual concepts. Crowdsourcing platforms offer an inexpensive method to capture human knowledge and understanding, for a vast number of visual perception tasks.
                <br><br>
                Crowdsourcing in Computer Vision describes the types of annotations computer vision researchers have collected using crowdsourcing, and how they have ensured that this data is of high quality while annotation effort is minimized. 
                <br><br>
                It begins by discussing data collection on both classic vision tasks, such as object recognition, and recent vision tasks, such as visual story-telling. It then summarizes key design decisions for creating effective data collection interfaces and workflows, and presents strategies for intelligently selecting the most important data instances to annotate. It concludes with some thoughts on the future of crowdsourcing in computer vision.
                <br><br>
                Crowdsourcing in Computer Vision provides an overview of how crowdsourcing has been used in computer vision, enabling a computer vision researcher who has previously not collected non-expert data to devise a data collection strategy. It will also be of help to researchers who focus broadly on crowdsourcing to examine how the latter has been applied in computer vision, and to improve the methods that can be employed to ensure the quality and expedience of data collection.

            <h3>Computer Vision: From 3d Reconstruction to Visual Recognition</h3>
            <p>Author :  Fei-Fei Li  / Savarese, Silvio <br>
                Publishing :  Morgan & Claypool <br>
                Publication date :  2013/10/15 <br>
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h6>
                Introduction</h6><br><br><p>
                When a 3-dimensional world is projected onto a 2-dimensional image, such as the human retina or a photograph, reconstructing back the layout and contents of the real-world becomes an ill-posed problem that is extremely difficult to solve. Humans possess the remarkable ability to navigate and understand the visual world by solving the inversion problem going from 2D to 3D. 
                <br><br>
                Computer Vision seeks to imitate such abilities of humans to recognize objects, navigate scenes, reconstruct layouts, and understand the geometric space and semantic meaning of the visual world. These abilities are critical in many applications including robotics, autonomous driving and exploration, photo organization, image, or video retrieval, and human-computer interaction. 
                <br><br>
                This book delivers a systematic overview of computer vision, comparable to that presented in an advanced graduate level class. The authors emphasize two key issues in modeling vision: space and meaning, and focus upon the main problems vision needs to solve, including: mapping out the 3D structure of objects and scenes; recognizing objects; segmenting objects; recognizing meaning of scenes; understanding movements of humans.
                <br><br>
                Motivated by these important problems and centered on the understanding of space and meaning, the book explores the fundamental theories and important algorithms of computer vision, starting from the analysis of 2D images, and culminating in the holistic understanding of a 3D scene.
