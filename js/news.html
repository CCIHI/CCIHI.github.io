            <p class="py-4 news_p">When it comes to young leaders in the field of computer vision, there should be no one more representative than Fei Fei Li. As a tenured professor in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University and the chief scientist of Google Cloud, Fei Fei Li has led the exploration of new directions that closely integrate academia and industry. And her role as a woman gives her a new and different perspective in the exploration of artificial intelligence diversity.
            <br><br>
            On January 15, at The Future Forum 2017 Annual Meeting and the first Future Science Award ceremony, Fei Fei Li, as a representative of the field of artificial intelligence, delivered a keynote speech entitled "The Quest for Visual Intelligent". In the speech, Fei Fei Li began with the emergence of vision in the biological field, and then elaborated on four perspectives in the process of computer vision exploration: from the perspective of child growth, brain development, technology practitioners, educators and mothers, how to view computer vision and artificial intelligence.
            <br><br> 
            In the last part of his speech, Li asked the question: AI will change the world, but the real question here is, who will change AI? As a result, she encourages the diverse development of artificial intelligence, allowing more people and cultures to participate in related research and industry, so that we will see a big explosion in technological discoveries that will change our world for the better.

            About 500 million years ago, some very simple creatures lived in the oceans, catching prey or becoming food for others. The animal world was very simple at that time, only a few simple species existed, and later, perhaps by accident or the "hand of God", some creature developed the first pair of real </p>

            <h3>Crowdsourcing in Computer Vision</h3>
            <p>Author :  Fei-Fei Li <br>
                Publishing :  Flatiron Books <br>

            <h6>
                Introduction</h6><br><br><p>
                Computer vision systems require large amounts of manually annotated data to properly learn challenging visual concepts. Crowdsourcing platforms offer an inexpensive method to capture human knowledge and understanding, for a vast number of visual perception tasks.
                <br><br>
                Crowdsourcing in Computer Vision describes the types of annotations computer vision researchers have collected using crowdsourcing, and how they have ensured that this data is of high quality while annotation effort is minimized. 
                <br><br>
                It begins by discussing data collection on both classic vision tasks, such as object recognition, and recent vision tasks, such as visual story-telling. It then summarizes key design decisions for creating effective data collection interfaces and workflows, and presents strategies for intelligently selecting the most important data instances to annotate. It concludes with some thoughts on the future of crowdsourcing in computer vision.
                <br><br>
                Crowdsourcing in Computer Vision provides an overview of how crowdsourcing has been used in computer vision, enabling a computer vision researcher who has previously not collected non-expert data to devise a data collection strategy. It will also be of help to researchers who focus broadly on crowdsourcing to examine how the latter has been applied in computer vision, and to improve the methods that can be employed to ensure the quality and expedience of data collection.

            <h3>Computer Vision: From 3d Reconstruction to Visual Recognition</h3>
            <p>Author :  Fei-Fei Li  / Savarese, Silvio <br>
                Publishing :  Morgan & Claypool <br>
                Publication date :  2013/10/15 <br>
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h6>
                Introduction</h6><br><br><p>
                When a 3-dimensional world is projected onto a 2-dimensional image, such as the human retina or a photograph, reconstructing back the layout and contents of the real-world becomes an ill-posed problem that is extremely difficult to solve. Humans possess the remarkable ability to navigate and understand the visual world by solving the inversion problem going from 2D to 3D. 
                <br><br>
                Computer Vision seeks to imitate such abilities of humans to recognize objects, navigate scenes, reconstruct layouts, and understand the geometric space and semantic meaning of the visual world. These abilities are critical in many applications including robotics, autonomous driving and exploration, photo organization, image, or video retrieval, and human-computer interaction. 
                <br><br>
                This book delivers a systematic overview of computer vision, comparable to that presented in an advanced graduate level class. The authors emphasize two key issues in modeling vision: space and meaning, and focus upon the main problems vision needs to solve, including: mapping out the 3D structure of objects and scenes; recognizing objects; segmenting objects; recognizing meaning of scenes; understanding movements of humans.
                <br><br>
                Motivated by these important problems and centered on the understanding of space and meaning, the book explores the fundamental theories and important algorithms of computer vision, starting from the analysis of 2D images, and culminating in the holistic understanding of a 3D scene.
